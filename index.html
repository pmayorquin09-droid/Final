      <h2>Systems Design, Engineering, and Organization</h2>
      <p>
        When considering the ideas of systems design, engineering, and organization, I would focus on simplicity in design, stability and performance in engineering, and data integration in organization. These aspects ensure that systems are reliable, adaptable, and usable by more people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplicity addresses problems with legibility, maintainability, and reliability (Connolly, 2025). Stability and performance address growth, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness (Toro, 2025). Data integration allows data from various sources to combine into a unified flow (LUMENALTA, n.d.).

      <h2>Content and Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        In developing a digital environment, I would focus on User-Centered Design and Content Relationships. These approaches ensure a better user experience by understanding needs and prioritizing content.
      </p>
      <p>
        User-Centered Design considers context and goals (Clay, 2025), while Content Relationships define how content pieces relate, creating a cohesive structure (Kaley, 2024).

      <h2>User Experience and Visual Design</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility and inclusivity are crucial for designing environments usable by all, enhancing the experience for everyone (NCDPI, 2024).  
        Aesthetic considerations ensure uncluttered interfaces, improving usability and focus (Livingston, n.d.).
      </p>

      <h2>Bias in Development</h2>
      <p>
        Data collection methods play a critical role in reducing bias. Drawing from diverse sources prevents skewed outcomes and ensures reliability. For example, relying solely on digital sources can introduce bias (Lieu et al., 2020).
